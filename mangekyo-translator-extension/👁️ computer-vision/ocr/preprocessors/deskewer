Key Features
Dual Detection Methods:
Hough Transform: Detects panel borders and speech bubble edges (geometric approach)
Projection Profiles: Optimized for text line detection (statistical approach)
Hybrid Mode: Combines both with confidence weighting (default)
CJK Optimizations:
Orientation detection distinguishes horizontal vs vertical text (critical for Japanese manga)
Projection profiles adapt based on detected text direction
Handles mixed-orientation pages
Performance Features:
Automatic downsampling for large images
OffscreenCanvas support for background processing
Configurable concurrency for batch operations
Performance monitoring integration
Quality Features:
High-quality bicubic interpolation for rotation
Adaptive thresholding for binarization
Sobel edge detection for Hough transform
Confidence scoring for reliability assessment
The module integrates with the existing performance-monitor.js utility and follows the project's architecture patterns. It's designed to work in both main thread and offscreen document contexts (MV3 compatible).

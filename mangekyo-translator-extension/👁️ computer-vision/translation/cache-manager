| Feature                    | Implementation                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-tier caching**     | Memory LRU → IndexedDB → Fuzzy matching  |
| **Intelligent eviction**   | LRU policy with size enforcement         |
| **Compression**            | Automatic compression for large entries  |
| **Fuzzy matching**         | Bigram-based similarity for near-matches |
| **Predictive preloading**  | Pre-translates next pages/common phrases |
| **Privacy-first**          | Optional encryption for cache export     |
| **Performance monitoring** | Built-in hit rate and compression stats  |

Integration Points
IndexedDB: Uses translationCacheDB for persistence
Encryption: Leverages secureStorage for encrypted exports
Background processing: Sends preload requests to service worker
Performance: Integrates with performanceMonitor for metrics
The cache manager optimizes for manga reading patterns—sequential page access and repetitive speech patterns—while maintaining strict privacy controls for user translation data.

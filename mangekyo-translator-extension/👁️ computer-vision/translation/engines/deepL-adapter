Usage Examples

// Basic usage
const result = await deepLAdapter.translate("おはようございます", {
  sourceLang: "ja",
  targetLang: "en",
  formality: "less" // Casual "Good morning" vs formal
});

// With glossary for consistent terms
await deepLAdapter.createGlossary("Manga Terms", [
  { source: "忍術", target: "Ninjutsu" },
  { source: "写輪眼", target: "Sharingan" }
], "ja", "en");

// Batch translate entire page
const bubbles = ["どうした？", "なんでもない", "行こう"];
const results = await deepLAdapter.translateBatch(bubbles, {
  targetLang: "en",
  formality: "default"
});

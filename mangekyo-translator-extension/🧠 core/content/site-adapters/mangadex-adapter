Key MangaDex-Specific Features:

| Feature                         | Implementation                             | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **MD\@Home Integration**        | Intercepts `window.__DATA__` and API calls | Direct access to image server URLs without scraping   |
| **Reader Mode Detection**       | CSS class and computed style analysis      | Handles both paginated and long-strip modes           |
| **Lazy Loading Interception**   | `src` setter override + MutationObserver   | Catches images before they load for OCR preprocessing |
| **Page Preloading**             | IndexedDB cache with LRU eviction          | Smooth navigation in long chapters                    |
| **Dynamic Overlay Positioning** | Scroll-aware visibility toggling           | Critical for infinite scroll long-strip mode          |

Integration Points:
Extends: generic-manga-adapter.js (base class with common methods)
Uses: mutation-observer.js for DOM watching
Emits: manga-translator:pageDiscovered, manga-translator:pageChanged
Consumes: ImageCache for preloading
MangaDex Challenges Addressed:
MD@Home Server Rotation: Handles dynamic base URL changes
Data Saver Mode: Adapts to lower quality images
Long-Strip Performance: Virtualizes overlays for 100+ page chapters
SPA Navigation: Detects chapter changes without page reload
Anti-Scraping: Uses official API endpoints when available
Would you like me to elaborate on the long-strip virtualization strategy or the MD@Home server failover handling?

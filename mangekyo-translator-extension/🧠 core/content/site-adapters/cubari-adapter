Key Features of this Implementation:
Cubari-Specific Handling
Dynamic Content: Handles React-based lazy loading with mutation observers
Multi-Source Images: Supports Imgur, Reddit, GitHub, Catbox sources
URL Parsing: Extracts series/chapter IDs from /read/:series/:chapter/ pattern
High-Res Recovery: Converts compressed Imgur/Reddit URLs to original quality
Technical Optimizations
Hydration Detection: Waits for React to finish rendering
Image Interception: Overrides Image.prototype.src to catch dynamic loads
WeakSet Tracking: Memory-efficient processed image tracking
Navigation Handling: Detects React Router navigation changes
Integration Points
Extends MangaAdapter base class (assumed)
Emits events: ready, imageLoaded, imagesUpdated, navigation, extractText
Compatible with the image-processor.js and bubble-detector.js pipeline
Would you like me to create the corresponding base-adapter.js abstract class, or implement any of the other site adapters (MangaDex, Webtoon) with similar patterns?

Resilience Patterns
Circuit Breaker: Auto-disable failing engines after 5 errors
Rate Limiting: Per-engine request throttling
Intelligent Fallback: Automatic engine switching on failure
Timeout Management: Configurable per-engine timeouts
Performance Optimizations
Smart Caching: Different TTL per engine (DeepL stable = 7 days, Local = 1 hour)
Batch Processing: Concurrent translation with concurrency limits
Vision Optimization: GPT-4 Vision only when image data provided
Security
Encrypted Key Storage: API keys in SecureStorage (AES-256-GCM)
No Key Exposure: Keys never logged or sent to content scripts
Request Signing: Proper authorization headers per service
Manga-Specific Features
Honorifics Preservation: Configurable Japanese honorific handling
Context Awareness: Maintains narrative flow across bubbles
SFX Translation: Specialized handling for sound effects (via GPT-4)
Dictionary Integration: Jisho lookup for word definitions
The manager handles the complex orchestration of paid APIs (cost control), free alternatives (rate limits), and local models (privacy) while providing a unified interface to the rest of the extension.

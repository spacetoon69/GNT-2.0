Key Features:
Multi-Layer Storage Strategy

| State Type | Storage                  | Use Case                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Settings   | `chrome.storage.sync`    | Cross-device preferences  |
| Session    | `chrome.storage.session` | Temporary UI state (MV3)  |
| Cache      | `chrome.storage.local`   | Translation cache, images |
| Secure     | Encrypted (AES-256-GCM)  | License keys, credentials |
| Stats      | `chrome.storage.local`   | Usage analytics           |


Reactive Architecture
Pub/Sub Pattern: Subscribe to specific keys or nested paths
Computed State: Derived values with automatic dependency tracking
Immediate Callbacks: Get current value on subscription
Batch Updates: Atomic multi-key transactions
Advanced Capabilities
Path-based Access: state.set('settings', 'translation.engine', 'deepl')
Schema Validation: Type checking and constraints on all updates
Serialization: Automatic handling of Set, Map, Date objects
Cross-Context Sync: Real-time synchronization across popup/content/background
Import/Export: JSON backup/restore with migration support
Performance Optimizations
Cloning Strategy: Deep clones on read to prevent external mutations
Change Detection: Deep equality checks prevent unnecessary updates
Lazy Loading: Schemas loaded on-demand
Memory Management: Automatic cleanup of subscribers
Integration Points
SecureStorage: Encrypted storage for sensitive data
EventRouter: Broadcasts changes to all extension contexts
APIManager: Shares translation cache state
UI Components: Reactive binding for real-time updates
The manager provides Redux-like predictability with Vue-like reactivity, optimized for Chrome extension architecture with multiple isolated contexts.

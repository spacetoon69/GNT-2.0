This implementation provides:
Core Scheduling:
Chrome Alarms API integration for MV3 persistence
Interval-based and scheduled-time tasks
One-time task scheduling (post-update optimization)
System wake detection and missed task recovery
Task Management:
Priority-based execution (critical, high, medium, low)
Conditional execution (online, license status, idle state, storage pressure)
Timeout protection with automatic retry and exponential backoff
Concurrent execution prevention (task locking)
Maintenance Tasks:
Cache maintenance: Expired entry cleanup, storage compaction
License validation: Periodic checks, trial expiration handling
Data retention: Privacy policy enforcement (GDPR/CCPA)
Performance metrics: Collection with privacy-respecting aggregation
Cloud sync: Translation cache synchronization
Image cleanup: LRU-based cache trimming
Language preloading: Weekly model updates
Health checks: System integrity monitoring
Update checks: Extension update availability
Safety Features:
Task state persistence for recovery
Graceful degradation on failure
Critical task failure notifications
Storage pressure detection
Memory usage monitoring
Condition-based rescheduling
MV3 Optimizations:
Efficient alarm scheduling (minimum 1 minute intervals)
Non-persisting low-priority tasks
Service worker-friendly async operations
State restoration after browser restart

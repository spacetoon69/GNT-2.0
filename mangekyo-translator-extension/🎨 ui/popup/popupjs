Key features implemented:
Three-state transitions with proper spinning animations (Tomoe → EMS → Rinnegan)
Floating iris with drag-and-drop positioning that persists across sessions
Scroll detection integration to auto-trigger Rinnegan mode when reading
State persistence using Chrome storage API
Content script communication with auto-injection fallback
Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+S to toggle, Escape to deactivate)
Real-time stats synchronization with content script
Error handling and toast notifications
Touch support for mobile/tablet dragging
The script manages all animation classes timing to match the CSS keyframes and handles the complex state machine of the three dojutsu forms.

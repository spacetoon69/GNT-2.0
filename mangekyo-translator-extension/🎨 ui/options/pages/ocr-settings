This ocr-settings.js module provides:
Core OCR Configuration:
Language Management: Primary/secondary language selection with vertical text support
Tesseract Core: PSM (Page Segmentation Mode) and OEM (OCR Engine Mode) fine-tuning
Live Testing: Image upload with visual bounding box overlay and confidence stats
Image Preprocessing Pipeline:
Denoising: Bilateral, Gaussian, or NLMeans filters with strength levels
Contrast Enhancement: CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
Binarization: Adaptive, Otsu, or Sauvola thresholding methods
Deskew: Automatic rotation correction up to ±45°
Scaling: DPI targeting for optimal OCR resolution
Manga-Specific Detection:
Panel Detection: Layout analysis for reading order
Bubble Detection: ML-based (TensorFlow.js) or heuristic speech bubble detection
SFX Handling: Separate sound effects detection (Beta)
Reading Direction: RTL (Manga), LTR (Comics), TTB (Manhua) support
Performance Tuning:
Worker Management: Multi-threading control (1-4 workers)
Timeout & Retry: Configurable limits for reliability
Confidence Thresholding: Quality gates with fallback options
Computer Vision:
ROI Expansion: Padding around detected text regions
Text Height Filtering: Min/max size constraints
Overlap Merging: IoU-based duplicate detection
Experimental Features:
GPU Acceleration: WebGL support for preprocessing
WASM Optimization: Native-speed computations
Fast Mode: Speed vs. accuracy trade-off
Legacy Mode: Tesseract v4 compatibility
The module includes a live preview system with visual feedback for OCR testing and real-time bounding box visualization.
